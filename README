    Apache2::Filter::Minifier::CSS - CSS minifying output filter

SYNOPSIS

      <LocationMatch "\.css$">
          PerlOutputFilterHandler   Apache2::Filter::Minifier::CSS
    
          # if you need to supplement MIME-Type list
          PerlSetVar                CssMimeType  text/plain
    
          # if you want to explicitly specify the minifier to use
          #PerlSetVar               CssMinifier  CSS::Minifier::XS
          #PerlSetVar               CssMinifier  CSS::Minifier
          #PerlSetVar               CssMinifier  MY::Minifier::function
      </LocationMatch>

DESCRIPTION

    Apache2::Filter::Minifier::CSS is a Mod_perl2 output filter which
    minifies CSS using CSS::Minifier or CSS::Minifier::XS.

    Only CSS style-sheets are minified, all others are passed through
    unaltered. Apache2::Filter::Minifier::CSS comes with a list of known
    acceptable MIME-Types for CSS style-sheets, but you can supplement that
    list yourself by setting the CssMimeType PerlVar appropriately (use
    PerlSetVar for a single new MIME-Type, or PerlAddVar when you want to
    add multiple MIME-Types).

    Given a choice, using CSS::Minifier::XS is preferred over
    CSS::Minifier, but we'll use whichever one you've got available. If you
    want to explicitly specify which minifier you want to use, set the
    CssMinifier PerlVar to the name of the package/function that implements
    the minifier. Minification functions are expected to accept a single
    parameter (the CSS to be minified) and to return the minified CSS on
    completion. If you specify a package name, we look for a minify()
    function in that package.

 Caching

    Minification does require additional CPU resources, and it is
    recommended that you use some sort of cache in order to keep this to a
    minimum.

    Being that you're already running Apache2, though, here's some examples
    of a mod_cache setup:

    Disk Cache

      # Cache root directory
      CacheRoot /path/to/your/disk/cache
      # Enable cache for "/css/" location
      CacheEnable disk /css/

    Memory Cache

      # Cache size: 4 MBytes
      MCacheSize 4096
      # Min object size: 128 Bytes
      MCacheMinObjectSize 128
      # Max object size: 512 KBytes
      MCacheMaxObjectSize 524288
      # Enable cache for "/css/" location
      CacheEnable mem /css/

METHODS

    handler($filter)

      CSS minification output filter.
